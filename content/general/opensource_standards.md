## Open Standards Requirement for Software
### The Requirement
 > *An **"open standard"** must not prohibit conforming implementations in open source software.*

### The Criteria
To comply with the Open Standards Requirement, an *"open standard"* must satisfy the following criteria. If an *"open standard"* does not meet these criteria, it will be discriminating against open source developers.

1. **No Intentional Secrets**: The standard MUST NOT withhold any detail necessary for interoperable implementation. As flaws are inevitable, the standard MUST define a process for fixing flaws identified during implementation and interoperability testing and to incorporate said changes into a revised version or superseding version of the standard to be released under terms that do not violate the OSR.
2. **Availability**: The standard MUST be freely and publicly available (e.g., from a stable web site) under royalty-free terms at reasonable and non-discriminatory cost.
3. Patents: All patents essential to implementation of the standard MUST:
   - be licensed under royalty-free terms for unrestricted use, or
   - be covered by a promise of non-assertion when practiced by open source software
4. **No Agreements**: There MUST NOT be any requirement for execution of a license agreement, NDA, grant, click-through, or any other form of paperwork to deploy conforming implementations of the standard.
5. **No OSR-Incompatible Dependencies**: Implementation of the standard MUST NOT require any other technology that fails to meet the criteria of this Requirement.
